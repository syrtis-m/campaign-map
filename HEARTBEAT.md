# HEARTBEAT.md — overnight run: implement plans 021–025

**Suggested goal command:**
`/goal implement plans 021-025 per HEARTBEAT.md — resume from its checklist on every start, use opus subagents per phase, stop when all boxes are checked`

This file is the **single durable source of truth for run state**. Usage
limits WILL kill sessions mid-run (it happened twice on 2026-07-12); the run
must survive any kill with at most one phase of rework. Everything below
exists to make that true.

## Wake protocol (do this at EVERY session start / resume, before any work)

1. Read this file top to bottom. The checklist (§Checklist) says what's done;
   trust it only after step 2 confirms it.
2. Verify against reality: `git log --oneline -15` (checked boxes must have
   their commit hashes on `main`) and `git status` (uncommitted work = a
   phase was interrupted).
3. If the tree is dirty: finish the interrupted phase to its green gate if
   the remaining work is clear from the diff + the plan; otherwise
   `git stash` it, note what was stashed under §Log, and restart that phase
   clean. Never commit a red gate; never discard Jonah's dev-vault data
   (see rules below).
4. If a background subagent was running when the session died, resume it
   from its transcript (SendMessage) rather than respawning cold — but if
   its transcript is gone, respawn with the phase brief from the plan.
5. Continue at the first unchecked box, in order.

## Execution rules (non-negotiable)

- **Read first, once per session:** CLAUDE.md; the CURRENT plan file in full
  (its §0 carries the invariants + infra pitfalls); docs/06 (gate protocol).
- **Order is the checklist order** (021 first is deliberate: after 21-A the
  fast tier makes every later phase cheaper; after 21-C most lifecycle tests
  are headless). Dependencies are already encoded — do not resequence except:
  a BLOCKED phase may be skipped iff no later-executed box depends on it
  (note it under §Blocked and move on).
- **One phase = one green gate = one commit = one push.** Commit message
  convention: `plan02X-<phase>: <summary> [gate: <results>]`, ending with the
  Claude co-author line. Push `origin main` after every phase commit — the
  overnight machine could die too. Then flip the box here (add the commit
  hash), update PROGRESS.md, log judgment calls in DECISIONS.md, and include
  HEARTBEAT.md/PROGRESS.md/DECISIONS.md in that same commit or an immediate
  `state:` follow-up commit.
- **Subagents:** one Opus subagent per phase with a self-contained brief
  drawn from the plan (the plans' §0 sections are written for exactly this).
  Orchestrator verifies independently (fast suite + tsc minimum) before
  committing. Subagents never commit.
- **Tier discipline** (from plan 021 §2.6, once 21-A lands): inner loop = fast
  suite; full board ONLY at arc milestones marked ⛳ below — not per phase.
  Until 21-A lands, phases 21-A/21-B use today's protocol.
- **Jonah's data:** `dev-vault/Campaigns/Vespergate` is real campaign data —
  byte-intact after every gate (git diff empty or frontmatter-formatting
  only). Gate fixtures: name-tagged, self-cleaning.
- **Open questions in plans:** decide, log decision + rationale in
  DECISIONS.md, flag under §Questions here. Never guess silently, never stall
  waiting for Jonah overnight.
- **Do not** modify plan files except status stamps; do not relitigate locked
  decisions; determinism rules D1–D6 bind every phase.

## Blocked
(none — add entries as `- <box-id>: <why> — <what's needed>`)

## Questions for Jonah (answered decisions logged in DECISIONS.md; morning digest)
(none yet)

## Log (one line per session/kill/resume — newest first)
- 2026-07-12 (arc run, session 1): resumed on dirty tree (partial phase1
  fixture fix) — finished it inside 21-A per wake protocol. 21-A green +
  committed (4adb2eb): fast tier 314 tests ~14 s, fuzz 2/72 s, phase1 16/16
  w/ dev-vault byte-clean, determinism-break injection caught by fast tier.
  Green-board ref lives in `.lastgreenboard` (currently b8e6e04 = v4.3 board).
- 2026-07-12 (later): v4.3 committed — plan 020 fully DONE; arc starts clean
  at 21-A. NOTE for 21-B/21-C: renderer degraded on the 4th gate-scale
  workload in one Obsidian process (3 ran clean) — a concrete repro anchor.
- 2026-07-12: file created; arc not started.
