## How evals work

Each skill has a Promptfoo eval config in `evals/prompts/`. When run, Promptfoo
injects the skill's `SKILL.md` as the system prompt, runs the test prompts against
the model, and checks responses against assertions.

### Skill injection

`lib/skill-prompt.mjs` is a shared Promptfoo prompt function used by every eval config.
It reads the skill file specified by `vars.skillFile` and constructs the messages array —
system message containing the skill content, followed by the user prompt. Each skill
YAML sets `vars.skillFile` to the path of its `SKILL.md`.

Passing `--var injectSkill=false` on the CLI omits the system message, leaving the model
to answer from training data alone. This is used for the baseline check.

Two assertion types are used:

- **`icontains`** — deterministic substring check; verifies a required term appears in the response. Use this for non-negotiable specific terms where the response is wrong if the term is absent — a required API name, CLI command, or configuration key. Pair with `llm-rubric` for the broader correctness check.
- **`llm-rubric`** — qualitative check evaluated by a judge model; the `value` field
  describes what a correct answer must include — keep items specific and checkable,
  not "gives good advice"

**Important:** Never use `--providers` on the CLI — it bypasses `lib/skill-prompt.mjs`,
so the skill will not be injected. The provider must be configured in the YAML.

## Setup

Evals use [Promptfoo](https://promptfoo.dev/), pinned as a dev dependency in `package.json`.
Run `npm install` once before running evals locally.

Current models:

| Role          | When                        | Provider                                      | Model ID                       |
| ------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Generator     | All runs                    | [Cerebras](https://inference.cerebras.ai/)    | `cerebras:gpt-oss-120b`        |
| Judge (CI)    | CI only                     | [Cerebras](https://inference.cerebras.ai/)    | `cerebras:gpt-oss-120b`        |
| Judge (local) | Optional — stronger quality | [Google Gemini](https://aistudio.google.com/) | `google:gemini-2.5-flash-lite` |

Skill eval YAMLs reference these IDs directly. When models change, update this table
and the model IDs in the YAML files and CI workflows.

**Cerebras** (required for all runs):

1. Sign up at [inference.cerebras.ai](https://inference.cerebras.ai/) (free, requires account).
2. Create an API key and add it to your shell:

```bash
export CEREBRAS_API_KEY=your_key_here
echo 'export CEREBRAS_API_KEY=your_key_here' >> ~/.zshrc
```

**Google Gemini** (optional — recommended for baseline validation):

Gemini is a stricter judge and is better at catching responses that satisfy the
letter of a rubric without the required reasoning. Use it when validating that new
tests have discriminating power.

1. Get a free API key at [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com/).
2. Add it to your shell:

```bash
export GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_key_here
echo 'export GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_key_here' >> ~/.zshrc
```

## Running evals

Run the eval for the skill you are working on:

```bash
# Cerebras judge (default — uses CEREBRAS_API_KEY only):
npm run eval -- \
  --config evals/prompts/<skill-name>.yaml \
  --no-cache -j 1

# Gemini judge (optional — stronger; requires GOOGLE_API_KEY):
npm run eval -- \
  --config evals/prompts/<skill-name>.yaml \
  --grader google:gemini-2.5-flash-lite \
  --delay 2000 --no-cache -j 1
```

All assertions must pass before pushing.

To view results interactively after any run:

```bash
npx promptfoo view
```

Local results are ephemeral — terminal output and `promptfoo view` are sufficient.

## Proving tests fail without the skill

Before writing skill content, verify your eval prompts have discriminating power —
they should fail without the skill and pass with it. Run the baseline check with
`--var injectSkill=false` to omit the skill from the system prompt:

```bash
npm run eval -- \
  --config evals/prompts/<skill-name>.yaml \
  --var injectSkill=false \
  --grader google:gemini-2.5-flash-lite \
  --delay 2000 --no-cache -j 1
```

Explicit, implicit, and anti-pattern tests must all fail without the skill — if any of
these pass, the prompt is not testing skill-specific knowledge and must be revised.
Negative tests require judgment: a negative test that passes without the skill may still
be valid if it is close enough to the skill's topic to confirm the skill doesn't over-apply.

## Writing eval prompts

When contributing a new skill, copy `evals/prompts/TEMPLATE.yaml` and rename it to
match your skill directory. Each eval config contains four to five tests — one of each type:

| Type         | Description                                        |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Explicit     | Names the topic directly                           |
| Implicit     | Describes the scenario without naming the solution |
| Anti-pattern | A wrong approach the skill should correct          |
| Negative     | An adjacent question the skill should not dominate |

Write the `value` field of each `llm-rubric` assertion as a checklist of what a correct
answer must include. Make items specific enough for a judge model to evaluate — "mentions
`addProtocol` by name" rather than "explains the API."

**Negative tests:** The question should be adjacent to the skill's topic — close enough
that an over-eager skill might incorrectly push the user toward the skill's solution, but
where doing so would be wrong or unhelpful. A trivially unrelated question (e.g. asking
about a completely different library) has no discriminating power. The rubric should
assert what a correct answer does: answers the actual question asked, and does NOT
recommend the skill's solution where it doesn't apply.

Write prompts based on real developer confusion — GitHub issues, Stack Overflow questions,
or Slack threads where AI assistants are known to fail.

## Example results

`evals/results/` contains example before/after responses showing each skill's effect on
model output. These are useful for understanding what discriminating power looks like and
what "failing without the skill" means in practice.

- [`example-mapbox-migration.md`](results/example-mapbox-migration.md) — full questions
  and responses for the maplibre-mapbox-migration skill
- [`example-pmtiles-patterns.md`](results/example-pmtiles-patterns.md) — full questions
  and responses for the maplibre-pmtiles-patterns skill
- [`example-tile-sources.md`](results/example-tile-sources.md) — full questions
  and responses for the maplibre-tile-sources skill

## CI

<!-- TODO: set up CI workflows, including setup, environment variables, and troubleshooting steps. -->

Two workflows run evals automatically:

- **`eval-pr.yml`** — Triggered on PRs that modify `skills/**` or `evals/prompts/**`.
  Runs only the eval configs for the modified skills. All assertions must pass to merge.
- **`eval-scheduled.yml`** — Runs every Monday against all skills on `main`. Results are
  committed to `evals/results/` after every run (pass or fail). Opens a GitHub issue
  tagged `eval-regression` if any skill fails.

Both workflows use the provider configured in each eval YAML as both generator and
judge. Requires the corresponding API key in repository secrets.
